# Style Guidelines

## Icons Overview

- All icons must be directly from FontAwesome (AI Matrix)
- If you're creating something, even if you don't know what icon to use, select something that makes sense
- Your choice can be updated later, but don't leave it blank or use meaningless things or placeholders

## Icon Selection

- Use Solid Style for core functionality icons like settings, home, and primary actions.
- Regular Style could be used for secondary actions and features.
- Light or Thin Styles are excellent for background elements and less critical actions, helping maintain an uncluttered look.
- DuoTone Style could be a distinctive style for branding elements or special features that need to stand out.
